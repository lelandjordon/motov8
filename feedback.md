## Technical Requirements

The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD. You've got 3 tables in your database and are doing some cool stuff user auth and limiting controller action to authorized users.

## Creativity and Interface

The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page. This is the area that your app could most improve. It would have been awesome if you had done a little more to make the interface your own instead of relying so heavily on Tunr. Don't be afraid to try new things, that's what creativity is about!

Evaluation: *Progressing*

## Code Quality

Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues. The code looks really nice and neat overall. Great job!

Evaluation: *Performing/Excelling*

## Deployment and Functionality

Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app. As far as I can tell the deployed version of the app functions the same as the development one which is awesome!

## Planning / Process / Submission

Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues.
You could have included more user stories and made each more specfic. A great tip as you work on more complicated projects is to update your user stories as you develop the project to indicate which have been completed and add additional ones as you think of them. A website like trello makes tracking this stuff easier.
